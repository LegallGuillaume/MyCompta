## Running the tests 

There are 2 tests available in this repository.
the first one allows to test all python classes and objects **unit test** (exclude website). The second allows to test all functions **functional test** (exclude website)

### Unit test
*These tests check if there are no regression only with object creation (exclude website)*

```

$ echo $?
```
Log file is generate in root of project *(test_unit.log)* \
**if echo $? = 0 is OK else > 0 is FAILED**

### Functional test
*These tests check if there are no regression with the global function (exclude website)*

```
$ python3 manage.py --testfunc
$ echo $?
```
Log file is generate in root of project *(test_works.log)* \

$ python3 manager.py --run
$ echo $?
```
Log file is generate in root of project *(server.log)*\
